Windows 7 下的使用说明：
1. Stop the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS) (which prompt an error message when I tried to install the client)
2. Install Juniper Client and ignore the error messages about the virtual adapter
3. Restart your PC
4. If Microsoft IKE and IPSec services are running, stop them
5. Import you Security Policy
6. Startup the Service SafeNet IKE Service (which fails to start automatically)
7. Connect to your network

Note: You won’t see the IP address provided by you Firewall because the virtual adapter was not installed.
