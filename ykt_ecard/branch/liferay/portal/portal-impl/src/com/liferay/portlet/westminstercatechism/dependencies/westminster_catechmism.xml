			<question>What do we pray for in the fifth petition?</question>
			<answer><![CDATA[In the fifth petition, (which is, <i>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</i>[a]) acknowledging, that we and all others are guilty both of original and actual sin, and thereby become debtors to the justice of God; and that neither we, nor any other creature, can make the least satisfaction for that debt:[b] we pray for ourselves and others, that God of his free grace would, through the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, apprehended and applied by faith, acquit us both from the guilt and punishment of sin,[c] accept us in his Beloved;[d] continue his favour and grace to us,[e] pardon our daily failings,[f] and fill us with peace and joy, in giving us daily more and more assurance of forgiveness;[g] which we are the rather emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect, when we have this testimony in ourselves, that we from the heart forgive others their offenses.[h]]]></answer>

			<question>What do we pray for in the sixth petition?</question>
			<answer><![CDATA[In the sixth petition, (which is, <i>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,</i>[a]) acknowledging, that the most wise, righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and just ends, may so order things, that we may be assaulted, foiled, and for a time led captive by temptations;[b] that Satan,[c] the world,[d] and the flesh, are ready powerfully to draw us aside, and ensnare us;[e] and that we, even after the pardon of our sins, by reason of our corruption,[f] weakness, and want of watchfulness,[g] are not only subject to be tempted, and forward to expose ourselves unto temptations,[h] but also of ourselves unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover out of them, and to improve them;[i] and worthy to be left under the power of them:[j] we pray, that God would so overrule the world and all in it,[k] subdue the flesh,[l] and restrain Satan,[m] order all things,[n] bestow and bless all means of grace,[o] and quicken us to watchfulness in the use of them, that we and all his people may by his providence be kept from being tempted to sin;[p] or, if tempted, that by his Spirit we may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in the hour of temptation;[q] or when fallen, raised again and recovered out of it,[r] and have a sanctified use and improvement thereof:[s] that our sanctification and salvation may be perfected,[t] Satan trodden under our feet,[u] and we fully freed from sin, temptation, and all evil, forever.[v]]]></answer>

			<question>What doth the conclusion of the Lord's Prayer teach us?</question>
			<answer><![CDATA[The conclusion of the Lord's Prayer, (which is, <i>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</i>[a]) teacheth us to enforce our petitions with arguments,[b] which are to be taken, not from any worthiness in ourselves, or in any other creature, but from God;[c] and with our prayers to join praises,[d] ascribing to God alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency, and glorious excellency;[e] in regard whereof, as he is able and willing to help us,[f] so we by faith are emboldened to plead with him that he would,[g] and quietly to rely upon him, that he will fulfil our requests.[h] And, to testify this our desire and assurance, we say, <i>Amen.</i>[i]]]></answer>
