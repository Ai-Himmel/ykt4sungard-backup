 * ServiceBuilder generated this class. Modifications in this class will be

 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides a JSON utility for the
 * <code>com.liferay.portal.service.PortalServiceUtil</code>
 * service utility. The static methods of this class calls the same methods of
 * the service utility. However, the signatures are different because it is
 * difficult for JSON to support certain types.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ServiceBuilder follows certain rules in translating the methods. For example,
 * if the method in the service utility returns a <code>java.util.List</code>,
 * that is translated to a <code>org.json.JSONArray</code>. If the method in the
 * service utility returns a <code>com.liferay.portal.model.Portal</code>,
 * that is translated to a <code>org.json.JSONObject</code>. Methods that JSON
 * cannot safely use are skipped. The logic for the translation is encapsulated
 * in <code>com.liferay.portal.service.http.PortalJSONSerializer</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This allows you to call the the backend services directly from JavaScript.
 * See <code>portal-web/docroot/html/portlet/tags_admin/unpacked.js</code> for a
 * reference of how that portlet uses the generated JavaScript in
 * <code>portal-web/docroot/html/js/service.js</code> to call the backend
 * services directly from JavaScript.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The JSON utility is only generated for remote services.
